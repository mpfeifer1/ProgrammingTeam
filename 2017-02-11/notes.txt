Everything starts null
Use a map, and an array of pointers
Add: Add pointer for T

Each node is a map of pointers

Basically a spell-checker data structure
It's a tree that doesn't have the complete key
Tries have more nodes

Any data can be typecasted to an array of bytes, then stored in a trie
These can replace hash tables very well, doesn't need a "perfect hash" becasue it can't have collisions
No need to change hash / resize table
Good for finding substrings

Three basic operations
    Insert
    FindWord
    FindPrefixes
