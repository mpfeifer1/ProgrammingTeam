split bananarama into a lot of suffixes, 
bananarama
ananarama
nanarama
anarama
narama
arama
rama
ama
ma
a

and then upload all of these into a trie like ususal
end of each leaf contains its starting position in text

You can shorten non-branching stems into a single edge
This is a sufix tree instead of a suffix trie

Suffix array - want a fast substring search, and pull it out in-context
    This is how Google makes a living...

Suffix sort: Create all the suffixes like above, then do a lexicographical sort
on all strings in the list, as this draws together suffixes.
This is log(N) on the length of the text as you can use binary search

This is huge for things like genomes because you can find long repeated strings
Also useful in cryptology so that you can find patterns
Also handy in data compression as you can compress large chunks
